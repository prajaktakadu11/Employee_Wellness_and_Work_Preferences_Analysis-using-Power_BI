# Introduction
In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving work environment, understanding employee preferences and monitoring wellness are critical for maintaining a productive and satisfied workforce. The shift towards remote work, accelerated by global events, has made it essential for organizations to analyze and adapt to new working patterns. This project, Employee Wellness & Work Preferences Analysis Dashboard, leverages Power BI to provide HR and management teams with comprehensive insights into employee attendance, work-from-home preferences, and overall wellness as indicated by sick leave data.

# Objective
The primary objective of this dashboard is to analyze employee attendance patterns to gain insights into their work preferences, particularly between working from home (WFH) and working from the office, as well as to monitor employee wellness through sick leave (SL) data. The insights derived from this analysis can help HR teams make informed decisions to improve employee satisfaction and overall productivity.

# Key Features of the Dashboard
- Work Preference Visualization:Visual representation of the number of days employees choose to work from home (WFH) compared to working from the office, helping to identify trends in 
  employee work preferences.
- Sick Leave Analysis:plays the total count and percentage of sick leave taken by employees, providing insights into employee wellness and potential health trends.
- Employee Attendance Breakdown: Detailed breakdown of attendance, including WFH days, office presence, and sick leaves, filtered by employee ID and name for personalized insights.
- Performance Indicators: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for quick insights into overall attendance, work-from-home trends, and wellness metrics, providing a snapshot of employee 
  engagement and health.
